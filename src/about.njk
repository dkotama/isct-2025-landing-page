                <h2>About the Conference</h2>
                <p>The International Symposium on Consumer Technologies (ISCT) is the premier global event
                    organized by the IEEE Consumer Technology Society (CTSoc). Since its establishment, ISCT has
                    brought together a diverse international audience, including researchers, industry leaders,
                    academics, and students, to explore groundbreaking advances in consumer technology. This
                    symposium serves as a vital forum for presenting innovative concepts, learning about
                    emerging trends, and exchanging ideas on consumer-focused technology with an emphasis on
                    sustainability and environmental impact.</p>

                <p>The 2025 edition of ISCT will again take place in Bali, Indonesia, continuing the legacy
                    established in its inaugural conference in 2024. Bali, known for its rich cultural heritage
                    and scenic beauty, offers a unique backdrop for professionals to connect and collaborate on
                    transformative consumer technologies in a sustainable environment.</p>

                <p>Accepted papers will be considered for inclusion in IEEE Xplore, following IEEE Xplore’s
                    scope and quality standards. Top papers will receive invitations to submit to special
                    editions of IEEE’s prestigious journals related to consumer technology.</p>
